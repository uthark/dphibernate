# Introduction #

There a two working sample projects that demo dpHibernate with Spring.

For a simple Lazy loading demo, check out the demo project here:
[Lazy loading with Spring](http://code.google.com/p/dphibernate/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fsamples%2FlazyLoadingWithSpring)

For a more complete demo project, that shows off full CRUD functionality, batched loading and message interceptors, check out the [Lazy Overflow](http://code.google.com/p/lazyoverflow/) project.


**Note : All other demo projects pertain to the 1.x codebase, and will not work with 2.x code**
